## Step 1: Sign Up for a Telnyx Mission Control Portal Account

Head to [telnyx.com/sign-up](https://telnyx.com/sign-up) to sign up for your free Telnyx account.

Once signed up you will have access to Telnyx Portal, where you can set up and manage your API KEY, and more.

## Step 2: Create an API KEY

Go to [API Keys](https://portal.telnyx.com/#/app/api-keys) section and click on `Create API Key` button. It will generate a key for you. Copy and save this key in a safe place and don't share it with anyone it is a sensitive value.

You need this API Key to consume the API `https://api.telnyx.com/v2/rooms` to manage your room ids.

## Step 3: Create a Room ID

You should read this documentation [video/Rooms](https://developers.telnyx.com/docs/api/v2/video/Rooms) to learn how to create a new video room id. When you get your `roomId` you can join in a video meet conference.

### Step 4. Set up environment variables

Create a new copy of `.env.sample` with the name `.env.local` and set the env var `TELNYX_API_KEY` with your Telnyx API KEY value.

Your `.env.local` file should look like this:

```js
TELNYX_API_HOST=https://api.telnyx.com/v2
TELNYX_API_KEY="KEYae7df0................"
```

## Step 5: Run the code

After you have cloned this repo:

```bash
  % git clone https://github.com/team-telnyx/telnyx-meet.git
```

Run the commands

1 - `yarn` to install the dependencies.

2 - `yarn dev` will initialize the server.

3 - Access the `http://localhost:3000/rooms`

4 - Fill the input `Room UUID` with your generated `roomId` from step 3.
